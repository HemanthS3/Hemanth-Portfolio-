# Server Quick Start Guide

Since you're already in the server directory, use these commands:

## Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Start the Server

```
npm start
```

## Test the Server

```
npm test
```

## Run in Development Mode (with auto-restart)

```
npm run dev
```

## Important Notes

1. The server will continue running in the terminal window until you stop it with Ctrl+C.
2. You need to have the server running for the contact form to work.
3. Make sure your .env file is configured with the correct email settings.
